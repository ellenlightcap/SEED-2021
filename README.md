# SEED-2021
Official repository for SEED 2021 for group "Glorified Roomba"

This Repository is organized by assignment. 
For each assingment for this course, there is a folder with the title of the assignment and inside this folder there will be a README file and other folders titled with the names of the group roles. 
Inside each of these individual folders, group members will upload their code so it is easily accessable by everyone on the team.
Each group member will have a README file inside their individual folders for each assignment as well and the final code used for each project will have its own folder as well labeled FINAL.
